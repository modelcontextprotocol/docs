## Client details

### Claude Desktop App
The Claude desktop application provides comprehensive support for MCP, enabling deep integration with local tools and data sources.

**Key features:**
- Full support for resources, allowing attachment of local files and data
- Support for prompt templates
- Tool integration for executing commands and scripts
- Local server connections for enhanced privacy and security

> ⓘ Note: The Claude.ai web application does not currently support MCP. MCP features are only available in the desktop application.

### Zed
[Zed](https://zed.dev/docs/assistant/model-context-protocol) is a high-performance code editor with built-in MCP support, focusing on prompt templates and tool integration.

**Key features:**
- Prompt templates surface as slash commands in the editor
- Tool integration for enhanced coding workflows
- Tight integration with editor features and workspace context
- Does not support MCP resources

### Sourcegraph Cody
[Cody](https://openctx.org/docs/providers/modelcontextprotocol) is Sourcegraph's AI coding assistant, which implements MCP through OpenCTX.

**Key features:**
- Support for MCP resources
- Integration with Sourcegraph's code intelligence
- Uses OpenCTX as an abstraction layer
- Future support planned for additional MCP features

### Firebase Genkit
[Genkit](https://github.com/firebase/genkit) is Firebase's SDK for building and integrating GenAI features into applications. The [genkitx-mcp](https://github.com/firebase/genkit/tree/main/js/plugins/mcp) plugin enables consuming MCP servers as a client or creating MCP servers from Genkit tools and prompts.

**Key features:**
- Client support for tools and prompts (resources partially supported)
- Rich discovery with support in Genkit's Dev UI playground
- Seamless interoperability with Genkit's existing tools and prompts
- Works across a wide variety of GenAI models from top providers

### Continue
[Continue](https://github.com/continuedev/continue) is an open-source AI code assistant, with built-in support for all MCP features.

**Key features**
- Type "@" to mention MCP resources
- Prompt templates surface as slash commands

## Adding MCP support to your application

If you've added MCP support to your application, we encourage you to submit a pull request to add it to this list. MCP integration can provide your users with powerful contextual AI capabilities and make your application part of the growing MCP ecosystem.

Benefits of adding MCP support:
- Enable users to bring their own context and tools
- Join a growing ecosystem of interoperable AI applications
- Provide users with flexible integration options
- Support local-first AI workflows

To get started with implementing MCP in your application, check out our [Python](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) or [TypeScript SDK Documentation](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk)

## Updates and corrections

This list is maintained by the community. If you notice any inaccuracies or would like to update information about MCP support in your application, please submit a pull request or [open an issue in our documentation repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/docs/issues).
