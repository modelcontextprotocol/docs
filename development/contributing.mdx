## MCP SDK Developer Guidelines

### Focus Areas

When building an MCP SDK, prioritize these three layers:

1. **Protocol Layer** - JSON-RPC message handling and transport
2. **API Layer** - Direct server/client interfaces with callbacks
3. **Ergonomic Layer** - Language-specific patterns and abstractions

### Minimum Requirements

For a functional MCP SDK:

- Implement STDIO transport (HTTP+SSE optional but recommended)
- Support all server features (resources, prompts, tools)
- Handle lifecycle management (initialization, operation, shutdown)
- Provide clear error handling

### Extended Requirements

- Client-side features (roots, sampling)
- Complex authentication mechanisms
- Extensive optimizations

### Design Principles

- Make simple things easy and complex things possible
- Follow language conventions for your target platform
- Provide good examples and documentation for common use cases
- Design with extensibility in mind as MCP evolves
