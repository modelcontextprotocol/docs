MCP is a protocol that enables secure connections between host applications, such as [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download), and local services. In this quickstart guide, you'll learn how to:

- Set up a local SQLite database
- Connect Claude Desktop to it through MCP
- Query and analyze your data securely

<Note>
While this guide focuses on using Claude Desktop as an example MCP host, the protocol is open and can be integrated by any application. IDEs, AI tools, and other software can all use MCP to connect to local integrations in a standardized way.
</Note>

<Warning>
Claude Desktop's MCP support is currently in developer preview and only supports connecting to local MCP servers running on your machine. Remote MCP connections are not yet supported. This integration is only available in the Claude Desktop app, not the Claude web interface (claude.ai).
</Warning>

## How MCP works

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol that enables secure, controlled interactions between AI applications and local or remote resources. Let's break down how it works, then look at how we'll use it in this guide.

### General Architecture
At its core, MCP follows a client-server architecture where a host application can connect to multiple servers:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Your Computer"
        Host["MCP Host\n(Claude, IDEs, Tools)"]
        S1["MCP Server A"]
        S2["MCP Server B"]
        S3["MCP Server C"]

        Host <-->|"MCP Protocol"| S1
        Host <-->|"MCP Protocol"| S2
        Host <-->|"MCP Protocol"| S3

        S1 <--> R1[("Local\nResource A")]
        S2 <--> R2[("Local\nResource B")]
    end

    subgraph "Internet"
        S3 <-->|"Web APIs"| R3[("Remote\nResource C")]
    end
```

- **MCP Hosts**: Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access resources through MCP
- **MCP Clients**: Protocol clients that maintain 1:1 connections with servers
- **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol
- **Local Resources**: Your computer's resources (databases, files, services) that MCP servers can securely access
- **Remote Resources**: Resources available over the internet (e.g., through APIs) that MCP servers can connect to

### In This Guide

For this quickstart, we'll implement a focused example using SQLite:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Your Computer"
        direction LR
        Claude["Claude Desktop"]
        MCP["SQLite MCP Server"]
        DB[(SQLite Database\n~/test.db)]

        Claude <-->|"MCP Protocol\n(Queries & Results)"| MCP
        MCP <-->|"Local Access\n(SQL Operations)"| DB
    end
```

1. Claude Desktop acts as our MCP client
2. A SQLite MCP Server provides secure database access
3. Your local SQLite database stores the actual data

The communication between the SQLite MCP server and your local SQLite database happens entirely on your machine&mdash;your SQLite database is not exposed to the internet. The Model Context Protocol ensures that Claude Desktop can only perform approved database operations through well-defined interfaces. This gives you a secure way to let Claude analyze and interact with your local data while maintaining complete control over what it can access.

      <Step title="Create a sample database">
        Let's create a simple SQLite database for testing:

        ```bash
        # Create a new SQLite database
        sqlite3 ~/test.db <<EOF
        CREATE TABLE products (
          id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
          name TEXT,
          price REAL
        );

        INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES
          ('Widget', 19.99),
          ('Gadget', 29.99),
          ('Gizmo', 39.99),
          ('Smart Watch', 199.99),

          ('Portable Charger', 24.99),
          ('Bluetooth Speaker', 79.99),
          ('Phone Stand', 15.99),
          ('Laptop Sleeve', 34.99),
          ('Mini Drone', 299.99),
          ('LED Desk Lamp', 45.99),
          ('Keyboard', 129.99),
          ('Mouse Pad', 12.99),
          ('USB Hub', 49.99),
          ('Webcam', 69.99),
          ('Screen Protector', 9.99),
          ('Travel Adapter', 27.99),
          ('Gaming Headset', 159.99),
          ('Fitness Tracker', 119.99),
          ('Portable SSD', 179.99);
        EOF
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Configure Claude Desktop">
        Open your Claude Desktop App configuration at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` in a text editor.

        For example, if you have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed:

        ```bash
        code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
        ```

        Add this configuration (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual username):

        ```json
        {
          "mcpServers": {
            "sqlite": {
              "command": "uvx",
              "args": ["mcp-server-sqlite", "--db-path", "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/test.db"]
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        This tells Claude Desktop:
        1. There's an MCP server named "sqlite"
        2. Launch it by running `uvx mcp-server-sqlite`
        3. Connect it to your test database

        Save the file, and restart **Claude Desktop**.

      </Step>

      <Step title="Configure Claude Desktop">
        Open your Claude Desktop App configuration at `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` in a text editor.

        For example, if you have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed:

        ```powershell
        code $env:AppData\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
        ```

                "--db-path",
                "C:\\Users\\YOUR_USERNAME\\test.db"
              ]
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        This tells Claude Desktop:
        1. There's an MCP server named "sqlite"
        2. Launch it by running `uvx mcp-server-sqlite`

</Tabs>

## Test it out

Let's verify everything is working. Try sending this prompt to Claude Desktop:

```
Can you connect to my SQLite database and tell me what products are available, and their prices?
```

Claude Desktop will:
1. Connect to the SQLite MCP server
2. Query your local database
3. Format and present the results

<Frame caption="Claude Desktop successfully queries our SQLite database ðŸŽ‰">
  <img src="/images/quickstart-screenshot.png" alt="Example Claude Desktop conversation showing database query results" />
</Frame>

## What's happening under the hood?

When you interact with Claude Desktop using MCP:

1. **Server Discovery**: Claude Desktop connects to your configured MCP servers on startup
2. **Protocol Handshake**: When you ask about data, Claude Desktop:
   - Identifies which MCP server can help (sqlite in this case)
   - Negotiates capabilities through the protocol
   - Requests data or actions from the MCP server

3. **Interaction Flow**:
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
       participant C as Claude Desktop
       participant M as MCP Server
       participant D as SQLite DB

       C->>M: Initialize connection
       M-->>C: Available capabilities

       C->>M: Query request
       M->>D: SQL query
       D-->>M: Results
       M-->>C: Formatted results
   ```

4. **Security**:
   - MCP servers only expose specific, controlled capabilities
   - MCP servers run locally on your machine, and the resources they access are not exposed to the internet
   - Claude Desktop requires user confirmation for sensitive operations

## Try these examples

Now that MCP is working, try these increasingly powerful examples:

<AccordionGroup>
